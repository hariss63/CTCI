## Data Structures
### Arrays and Strings
**[1.1 Is Unique:](https://github.com/munyari/CTCI/blob/master/Data_Structures/Array_String/UniqueString.java)** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

**[1.2 Check Permutation:](https://github.com/munyari/CTCI/blob/master/Data_Structures/Array_String/CheckPermutation.java)** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permuation of the other

**[1.5 One Away:](https://github.com/munyari/CTCI/blob/master/Data_Structures/Array_String/OneAway.java)** There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character and replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are within one edit of each other

**[1.9 String Rotation:](https://github.com/munyari/CTCI/blob/master/Data_Structures/Array_String/StringRotation.java)** Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, write code to check if `s2` is a rotation of `s1` using only once call to `isSubstring`
